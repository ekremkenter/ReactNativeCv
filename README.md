React Native CV App

Getting Started With React:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

JSON Resume Schema:
https://jsonresume.org/schema/

We will use JSON resume schema since it is becoming industry standart for building CVs. Our app will load that json from Firebase, or any CDN and build ui. Checkout github page for more details: https://github.com/jsonresume 

# Testing
```bash
cd ReactNativeCV
react-native run-ios
```
